Linked List:

	- addToHead():
		1. create new Node and initialize next to current head, and tail to null 
		2. if a head points to a Node, then assign current head's prev to this new Node
		3. else, (ie, Linked List is empty so...) assign current tail to point to new Node
		4. re assign head to point to this new Node

	- addToTail():
		1. create new Node and initialize next to null, and tail to current tail
		2. if a tail points to a Node, then assign current tail's next to this new Node
		3. else, (ie, Linked List is empty so...) assign current head to point to new Node
		4. re assign tail to point to this new Node

	- removeHead():
		1. if !head (ie, Linked List is empty so...) return null
		2. else, save current head's value (for returning upon completion)
		3. and, re assign head to point to current head's next (because we are removing current head)
		4. if head now points to a Node (ie, Linked List is not empty), then set this head's prev to null
		5. else (ie, Linked List is empty), re assign current tail to point to null
		6. return value of released Node
